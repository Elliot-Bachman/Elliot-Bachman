# 👋 Hi, I’m Elliot Bachman

🎯 **Aspiring Software Engineer** focused on full stack JavaScript development, with strong skills in React, Node.js, and building responsive, accessible interfaces.

🔧 I recently completed the TripleTen Software Engineering Program, where I developed real-world, full stack projects like:
- 🌦 **WTWR (What to Wear)** – Full stack weather app using React, Node.js, MongoDB, JWT Auth
- 📰 **News Explorer** – Frontend news search app using responsive design and external APIs

💻 I enjoy working on clean, scalable code and continuously improving my skills in tools like Git, VS Code, and Postman. I’m especially passionate about frontend development, UI/UX, and building things that make people’s lives easier.
